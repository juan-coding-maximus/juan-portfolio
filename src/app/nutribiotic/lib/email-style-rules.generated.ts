 * is stale or when the two engines disagree about a real string.
 *
 * Rules that need the source note in hand (an invented number, a greeting
 * naming nobody on file, a body that says nothing about this account) are not
 * here. They cannot be written as a pattern over the text, and they live in
 * ask-compose.ts, which is the only side holding the note.
