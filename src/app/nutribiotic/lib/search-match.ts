/**
 * ONE MATCHER FOR EVERY SEARCH BOX IN THIS OS (2026-09-17).
 *
 * Juan typed "Shine natural market, Encinitas" into the map's client field and
 * was told "No account of yours by that name." Shine Natural Market, Encinitas
 * is in his book, and typing "Shine" alone had just found it. Every box in the
 * OS carried its own copy of the same naive rule -- the whole query, as one
 * string, tested against one field -- so all of them failed the moment anyone
 * typed the way people actually type: the name plus the city, a comma, a
 * plural, a letter in the wrong place.
 *
 * THE RULE, IN ONE LINE: every word of the query has to land somewhere on the
 * record, rather than the whole sentence having to land in one field.
 *
 * RANK STILL DECIDES WHAT HE SEES FIRST. Forgiving on what matches, strict on
 * what leads: an exact name, then a name the query prefixes, then every word
 * hitting the start of a word in the name, and only then the looser tiers
 * where the city carried part of the query or a letter was off. A typo or a
 * city hit can put a row IN the list; it cannot push it past the row whose
 * name Juan actually typed.
 *
 * ALIASES APPLY TO BOTH SIDES, so canonicalizing "st" to "street" cannot
 * misfire: the record is folded the same way the query is, and the only thing
 * it costs is that "Dr. Pure Nature" and a Drive read alike in a name search,
 * which no one has ever needed kept apart.
 *
 * A SERVER SEARCH IS STILL ONE SUBSTRING. Boxes backed by PostgREST ilike or
 * HubSpot's CONTAINS_TOKEN cannot express any of this, so they fetch on the
 * most selective single word (selectiveTokens) and rank what comes back
 * through matchScore here, which is the same rule, just applied one step
 * later.
